# crt.sh + Steampipe

[crt.sh](https://crt.sh) provides a searchable database of certificate transparency logs.

[Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) is an
Internet security standard and open source framework for monitoring and
auditing digital certificates. The standard creates a system of public logs
that seek to eventually record all certificates issued by publicly trusted
certificate authorities, allowing efficient identification of mistakenly or
maliciously issued certificates.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Query certificates for a domain:

```sql
select
  dns_names,
  not_after
from
  crtsh_certificate
where
  query = 'steampipe.io';
```

```
+------------------------+---------------------------+
| dns_names              | not_after                 |
+------------------------+---------------------------+
| ["steampipe.io"]       | 2022-10-24T08:48:52-04:00 |
| ["cloud.steampipe.io"] | 2022-10-20T22:56:08-04:00 |
+------------------------+---------------------------+
```

Enumerate and discover subdomains for a given domain:

```sql
with raw_domains as (
  -- Search for any certificates matching steampipe.io
  select distinct
    jsonb_array_elements_text(dns_names) as domain
  from
    crtsh_certificate
  where
    query = 'steampipe.io'
)
select
  *
from
  raw_domains
where
  -- filter out mixed domains (e.g. from shared status page services)
  domain like '%steampipe.io'
order by
  domain
```

```
+--------------------+
| domain             |
+--------------------+
| cloud.steampipe.io |
| hub.steampipe.io   |
| steampipe.io       |
| www.steampipe.io   |
+--------------------+
