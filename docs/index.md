# crt.sh + Steampipe

[crt.sh](https://crt.sh) provides a searchable database of certificate transparency logs.

[Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) is an
Internet security standard and open source framework for monitoring and
auditing digital certificates. The standard creates a system of public logs
that seek to eventually record all certificates issued by publicly trusted
certificate authorities, allowing efficient identification of mistakenly or
maliciously issued certificates.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Query certificates for a domain:

```sql
select
  dns_names,
  not_after
from
  crtsh_certificate
where
  query = 'steampipe.io';
```

```
